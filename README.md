# Mail Generator

[Open the app](https://mateuszkocz.github.io/mail-generator/).


## Description

Generate and keep track of email addresses you're using to test your app with different users accounts. Add notes and easily manage the generated emails to make your QA job easy. Works with Gmail, custom domains and anything that can handle a + suffix.

You can start the counter from an arbitrary number by passing the number you want after the last + (eg. hello+10@gmail.com). The last generated email is automatically saved in the clipboard and is ready to paste in your app.

Emails and notes are stored locally in your browser. You have full control of your data.

Have fun!
